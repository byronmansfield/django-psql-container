# Django Learning

This project was built for me to learn practice and learn python and the Django framework. I am aiming to containerize it along with PostgreSQL and make a simple admin + client side application. Other goals are running it through Travis CI. If CI is successful I am building the container image and pushing it to dockerhub

## Developers Notes

I have made a Makefile for more automation with the development process

If you need to build the project

```bash
make build
```

## References

I'm mostly following along the [Django tutorial from their documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/) and the [Docker tutorial in their documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/#create-a-django-project)

## Notes

As this is a very new project and mostly for learning purposes, It may not fully be working. Please pull and run at your own risk
